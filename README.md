[![Appveyor Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/gitlab/stevebob/slime99?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/stevebob/slime99)

In the not-too-distant future, the year 1999, fallout from **THE WAR** has caused
**RADIOACTIVE MUTANT SLIMES** to appear in the sewers of **THE CITY**. You are a
**GENETICALLY-MODIFIED PRECOG SUPER-SOLDIER**, whose free-will was in-part traded
for the power to **PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF COMBAT ENCOUNTERS**. Go into the sewers
and **ELIMINATE THE SOURCE OF SLIME!**
